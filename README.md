A new HTML framework to help you get a quick start to your websites.

# About
I made this just to expand my knowlege of web development and for personal use, but anyone can use it when it's finished.

# Last Fork
Added index.html with a blank template. I also added a _reset.scss file for the reset css I'm going to use
